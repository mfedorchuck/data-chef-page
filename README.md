# data-chef-page
Flask web page for juggling data using few AWS cloud services (S3, Redshift, Athena, Lambda)

Currently under construction...

Before using code - install requirements (requirements.txt) and add some credentials to .aws/credentials (for correct communication with AWS services) (google it)
